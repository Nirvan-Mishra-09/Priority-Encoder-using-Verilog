# Priority-Encoder-using-Verilog

Priority Encoder is a combinational digital circuit, that take 2^n input lines and encodes it to n output signal lines. For instance for a 8x3 priority encoder the output lines with respect to 8, i.e., (2)^3 input lines are 3 output lines.

Working of Priority Encoder:
D7 is of highest priority, and D0 is of lowest priority. If D4 is on priority we ignore all the input lines before D4, as given diagram.
